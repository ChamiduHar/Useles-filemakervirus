Overview:
The Useless FileMaker Virus is a demonstration project written in Python that showcases how a simple script can behave like a computer virus. When executed, the program generates random files in the system, cluttering the directory. The purpose of this project is purely educational‚Äîto study malware behavior in a safe and controlled environment, not for malicious use.

Features:

Creates multiple random files with meaningless names.

Fills those files with random data.

Demonstrates how quickly a system can become cluttered.

Serves as an example for understanding basic virus-like behavior in Python.

Important Note:
